# CSSECDV - Secure Web Development

## Project
### Case Study 1 - Authentication

The case study focuses on the implementation of authentication mechanisms by designing user data with credentials and roles. The implementation also takes into account possible application vulnerabilities. 

### Case Study 2 - Authorization, Session Management, and Data Validation

The case study focuses on the implementation of authorization, session management, and data validation mechanisms of the application. The implementation also takes into account the access matrix which stipulates the functionalities available for each role in each aspect of the program (e.g., Login, Page Views, User/Product Addition/Modification/Deletion, etc.).

### Case Study 3 - Web Application Vulnerability Assessment/Pentesting (DVWA; Not part of the repo).
